# Introduction
This is a Chrome plugin that you can add using the Chrome Developer mode (not from the Chrome store). You need to use the Developer mode since there are no user options at the moment.
See [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/) on how to enable the Developer mode.

## Configuration
Checkout the code, open your favorite editor and change
* popup.html - Add your buttons. Change that silly title and picture.
* popup.js - Change HTML functions related to your buttons and enter your Jira labels.

## Enable the plugin
Load the plugin in the Chrome Developer mode.
Click the plugin and enjoy!
